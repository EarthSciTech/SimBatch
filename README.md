# SimBatch
SimBatch is a Python toolbox for running and evaluating batch simulations with reservoir simulators like RFD tNavigator and SLB Eclipse. It automates .DATA file execution, extracts key results from .RSM outputs, and generates structured reports for comparison, analysis, and decision-making.
